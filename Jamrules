## Jam stuff

# Fix for unnecessary rebuilding any Jam project
KEEPOBJS = true ; # This doesn't actually fix anything, though it seems like it should
NOARSCAN = true ; # This actually fixes the problem
#AR = ar rUu ; # I was thinking maybe the AR command was wrong (always outputting deterministically)
               # It doesn't seem like this is the problem though
AR = ar cr ;

# Cross compilation
# E.g.
# jam -j4 -q -sCROSS_COMPILE_WINDOWS=true
# if $(CROSS_COMPILE_WINDOWS)
# {
# 	CC = x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc ;
# 	LINK = x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc ;
# 	AR = x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar ;
# 	SUFSHR = .dll ;
# }

# Some helpful Jam commands
# -q        : stop on failed target
# -jN       : use N cores
# -sVAR=VAL : Set VAR to VAL. Note that setting WINDOWS=false is the same as setting UNREAL=true,
#              frustratingly
# -dx       : print commands being used
# -n        : don't actually run commands
